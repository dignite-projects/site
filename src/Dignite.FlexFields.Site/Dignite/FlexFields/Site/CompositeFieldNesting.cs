/// <c>InlineFieldValidator</c> recurses through <see cref="IFieldType.Validate"/>, the public site's

/// a reference, so it cannot cycle - but all of them cost depth-proportional stack and render work, and
/// none of them is usable at depth. Capping the tree once, where it is written, is what keeps every one

/// A field type whose value has a canonical wire shape it can re-derive from any structurally valid
/// input - Seo, Matrix and Table, whose values are composite objects with a fixed casing convention
/// (camelCase, matching every field type's own <c>JsonSerializerDefaults.Web</c> read path) that nothing
/// otherwise enforces on write.
/// <para>
/// <b>Why this has to exist.</b> <see cref="IFieldType.Validate"/> already parses a composite value
/// case-insensitively to check its shape, but returns only errors - never the parsed value - so a
/// structurally valid value with the "wrong" key casing (e.g. <c>MetaTitle</c> instead of
/// <c>metaTitle</c>) passes validation and is then persisted <i>exactly as received</i>
/// (<c>ContentManager.SetFieldValuesAsync</c> stores the raw bag value verbatim). Every reader downstream
/// - the Angular field-type controls in particular - expects the camelCase shape, so a value that
/// round-tripped through validation without this normalization step can be silently unreadable on the
/// client despite having saved without error.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Deliberately separate from <see cref="IFieldType.Validate"/>.</b> Validation answers "is this
/// value acceptable"; normalization answers "what is the one canonical way to store an acceptable
/// value" - conflating them would mean every future <c>Validate</c> override also has to remember to
/// double as a value transform. Called from <c>ContentManager.SetFieldValuesAsync</c>, before
/// validation, and only for field types that opt in - it is not a kernel-wide concept because none of
/// the six FlexFields-native field types have a composite value that needs canonicalizing.
